For now, If you have a question, fill [this issue](https://github.com/Vulca/F.A.Q/issues/3) or reach to us through the usual channels. \(whatsapp/slack/etc...\)

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
