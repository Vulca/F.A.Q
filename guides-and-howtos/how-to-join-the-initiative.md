# How to join the initiative?

### We have 3 types of point of entry. 

#### **Weekly** 

As teams are traveling around EU \(Vulca Tour\), participating to Makerfair \(and others events\)  or simply working on their side, spreading the good word locally, we meet people.    
If you want, we'll add new comer in our [Whatsapp ](https://www.whatsapp.com/)group and from there, you can volunteer yourself to join specific teams on our [slack](https://slack.com/) to talk and/or work on specific channels. 

#### Monthly

_**VULCA F.A.Q**_ 🙋🏼‍🙋🏻‍♂   
Every Month - 3 hrs - open video-conference   
**Objective:** To answer to all of your questions and update you with basic information or particular subject\(s\) about VULCA   
[You can meet us here](https://meet.google.com/ryu-jmsi-cyc)

#### Yearly

We invite all Vulca Members/Partners to join for a Seminar somewhere in Europe.
Join us for the [VULCA POLAND SEMINAR](www.vulca.eu/seminar_poznan/) from 2-4 MAY 2019.
